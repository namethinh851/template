I entered college without knowing what I wanted to become in life. As the result, I started to take courses in many different fields to see what sparked most interest in me. I thought the search was over when I took human anatomy. I was so fascinated with how the human body worked that I decided to pursue biochemistry to get into medical school. I pursued this new-found dream with great focus and discipline, which includes: volunteering at Leahi Hospital, doing academic research on the heart and metabolism, shadowing a physician, becoming president of the Pre-Med/Pre-Pharmacy club at Kapiolani Community College, taking the MCAT. The work put in to get to medical school was fierce, but I loved it.

As much as I loved studying to get into medical school, I started to feel something was still missing in my life; as if another part of me was not being used. Therefore, I dedicated my entire winter break in 2015 by taking multiple courses in Udemy.com to learn what other subjects sparked my interest. I enrolled in trading stocks, ecommerce, and programming. Of all those courses, there was one that I became extremely passionate in, and that was making iOS applications. The ability to transform an intangible idea into a tangible and usable application ignited the part of me that loved to create and build, to engineer. I immediately changed my major to computer engineering and a minor in computer science.

My goal now is to combine my love for medicine and engineering, and help create something that will benefit others. Therefore, I want to implement technology into health care, in order to provide services for the people of Hawaiâ€™i in a more accessible and affordable way.
