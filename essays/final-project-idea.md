# Project: I Stay No Mo!
###Overview
The problem: Parking sucks because it is hard to find one. We waste so much time, gas money to find a parking. Additionally, parking permit is limited.
The solution: This application allows people with parking that are leaving can notify those that are looking for parking to know thie location.

### Approach
Once a profile is created, others can browse the profiles filtered by locations. 

Students can also set up notifications to find out where the opening locations are. These locations are set up by the students that are leaving the parking soon.

Admins can monitor the parking that are being opened and the ones being taken.

Some mockup pages include:
..* Landing page
..* User home page
..* Admin home page
..* User profile page
..* Open parking page

### Use case ideas
Whether or not the following bullet points list all pages or not, the completed use case should show an end-to-end scenario of using the system.
..* New users goes to landing page, logs in, gets home page, sets up profile.
..* Admin goes to landing page, logs in, gets home page, edits site.
..* User goes to landing page, logs in, finds opening parking spots, or claiming vacant ones.
