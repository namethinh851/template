In 2017, my wife and I got a chance to visit Tokyo, Japan. Of all the amazing things we got to experience, one of our favorite things about this city was its train system. We got to travel many parts of Tokyo within in a matter of few days all thanks to its efficiency and map design, especially the latter. Why map design played such a crucial role in our trip? Because it was able to bring something as complex as the train system in Tokyo to be so comprehensive that even foreigner can use. Interestingly, the Japanese were not the one that created this design style, it was Britain, namely, Harry Beck. Prior to him coming with this brilliant design, the London underground map was more like a plate of spaghetti. This is the map in 1926.

I think I would definitely need a magnifying glass to be able to identify which name belonged to which station. The more the train system grew, the less readability the map would become. Apparently, I was not the only one thinking this way, because, in 1931, Harry Beck drew the map with the design style that later adopted by every railroad system in the world.

Similar to the train system, programming languages are highly complex. People have given up learning how to program for many reasons, one of those is its robotlike syntax. When I first looked at lines of code on the display of my laptop, I was completely lost, and I still am. For people like me, we need a Harry Beck in computer science industry to save us all! Fortunately, there is a programming language in web design that seemed to have been touched by Harry Beck. It is Semantic UI. "How?" you may ask. Let's take a look at a comparison between Bootstrap, another famous framework for web design, and semantic UI. In order to create a button like this one:

For bootstrap, we need to write the following code:

```
<button type="button" class="btn btn-primary btn-md">Button</button>    
```

For Semantic UI, we need the following code:

```
<button class="medium ui primary button">Button</button>
```

If I were to show the two lines of code to a 6 years old, who is still learning how to read, how long do you think it will take for him/her to figure out what the two lines are doing? I can bet that he/she can understand semantic UI faster than bootstraps. How do I know? Because I experience the same thing. Within less than a few days of learning semantic UI, and only a few hours each day, I was able to do homepage mockup of many different websites. The ease of readability and English-like syntax structure allow anyone to be able to learn web design quick and efficient. So next time if you want to give software engineering a try to create something cool, I recommend semantic UI. It will give you a big confidence boost! I know it did for me!
