As the world getting more mobile by the use of smart phones, the ability to develop lightweight and fast application becomes extremely crucial. The solution to this dire need lies in develop cloud-based apps, where most of the data are stored in the internet, instead of on the phone, to minimize application size. The data is communicated between the cloud and the phone is usually in API data interaction, which is in JSON or XML format. 

Seeing the importance of learning the necessary skills to integrate API into mobile applications, I started to develop an API-focused app, namely Chuck Norris Quotes.

[shows the code I use for Alamofire and to integrate API]


The purpose of this project is to learn how to useAlamofire as a tool to consume API for iPhones apps. Since https://api.chucknorris.io/ has the cleanest api and the easiest to consume, it becomes the best tool to practice.

Here are the snapshots from the app.
