# Election-2016-Data-Analysis (please click on the .ipynd to view the code)
Data Analysis on 2016 Election between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. The purpose of this project is to see if the amount of donors to donate to the candidates can affect directly their chances of winning the heart of American people, and hence, the Election.

The graph below illustrates the amount of donors for Hillary Clinton is much greater than Trump's.

If the hypothesis is true, Hillary Clinton should have a big lead in winning Trump and therefore win the election easily. 

However, this is not the case. If we look at the graph at below, which is located at Out[26] in the code, we can notice a different trend

Up means people favor Clinton more, down means people favor Trump more.

As the date of the General Election gets closer, Clinton starts to lose her favorbility among the American people. The reason why this happened can be left for others to discuss, the fact of the matter is: the probability of her losing the election increases each day closer to the Election day. Therefore, we can conclude that the amount of donors being donated to a candidate does not affect directly the chances of winning the Election.

Vacay is a web application that I helped create as a team project in ICS 415, Spring 2015. The project helped me learn how to design and implement a responsive web site.

Vacay is implemented using [Meteor](http://meteor.com), a JavaScript application platform. Within two weeks, we created a website that implements several types of reservations including flights, hotels, and car rentals.

In this project I gained experience with full-stack web application design and associated technologies, including [MongoDB](http://mongodb.com) for database storage, the [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) CSS Framework for the user interface, and Javascript for both client and server-side programming.
